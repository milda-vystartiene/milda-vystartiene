### Nice to meet you!👋

I'm a data analytics enthuziast with a mixed specialization background that allows me to be a universal tool in a company's toolbox:
```
- Data analytics (SQL, Spreadsheets, BigQuery)
- Data visualisations (Power Bi)
- Software development Project/ Product management
```
_Other tools that I use:_
```
- 3D modelling and rendering (3Ds Max)
- Video and image post production (Photoshop, After Effects)
- Graphic design (Illustrator)
- Web Design (Framer)
```

### I love: 🐕🐈🐱🐶🍕🍔✈️

Currently looking for areas where I can use that passion for data analytics and of course make a salary out of it 🙂
